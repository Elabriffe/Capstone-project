    "Paris is known for its culinary cuisine and culture. In addition, Paris is one of the most attractive cities in France where it is interesting to open a business. Moreover it is one of the most multicultural cities in France and therefore an interesting place to open a new business. Moreover we are one of the largest business centers in France, but also many cultural sites are present there attracting many tourists. So many advantages that can be interesting to open a restaurant."

    "Paris is a city of many cultures. In addition of many people from different backgrounds have settled in Paris: Africans, South Americans, Asians, Eastern Europeans and they have all brought with them their particular culture in the Parisian diversity. Thanks to this unique mix of cultures in Paris, you can find an infinite number of small ethnic restaurants that offer an alternative to the classic Parisian restaurants, the \"brasseries\".\n",
    "\n",
    "In Paris, as in the main cities of France, you will find all kinds of kitchens from every corner of the globe. And honestly, it is almost impossible to list all the countries represented in the Parisian gastronomic landscape here.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, due to colonial ties or mass immigration, some types of cuisine are more common and therefore easier to find. The list below therefore presents some of the most represented and influential countries in Paris gastronomy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vietnam**\n",
    "\n",
    "Vietnam was a French colony from 1887 to 1954 and, as a result, a large Vietnamese community resided in France. During the colonial period, both cultures strongly influenced their respective cuisines, as evidenced by dishes such as the Vietnamese \"banh mi\", a sandwich that uses a rice flour version of the famous French baguette. You can also find distinctly Vietnamese dishes, such as the \"pho\" (pronounced - fire -) which originated from the French \"pot au feu\".\n",
    "\n",
    "**Senegal**\n",
    "\n",
    "Like Vietnam, Senegal is another former colony whose culture and cuisine has strongly influenced France. Many Senegalese immigrants brought refined dishes such as \"Thiebou Yap\", (cooked beef or lamb, vegetables, seasonings, rice) and \"Yassa\", (chicken marinated in spices and simmered in a pan with mustard, onion and lemon juice, and served with rice).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Lebanon**\n",
    "\n",
    "Although France occupied Lebanon from World War I until the late 1950s, many Lebanese immigrated in 1975 because of the civil war, thus enlarging the small community that already existed in the country. These immigrants brought with them classic staple foods such as hummus and pita bread, as well as \"baba ganoush\", a dish made from roasted eggplant. Today, many Lebanese restaurants, from stalls to gourmet restaurants, dot the streets of Paris and beyond.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Morocco**\n",
    "\n",
    "People of Moroccan origin form one of the largest communities of foreign origin in France due to mass immigration after the colonial period. Like many other North African countries, Moroccan cuisine combines elements of diverse origins: Arabic, Mediterranean, Berber and other neighboring cultures. The classic Moroccan \"tajines\" cook meat or vegetables in a terracotta dish. And the \"Fassi B'stilla\" (or pastilla) is a kind of pie made of ingredients ranging from pigeon to chicken with cinnamon.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Japan**\n",
    "\n",
    "Japanese expatriates have frequently visited France since the 1870s to study and appreciate its culture. Today, many people of Japanese origin live there and many Japanese expatriates reside there for long periods of time. These long-established Japanese communities have introduced classic establishments such as sushi and noodle bars into the French culinary landscape. Many renowned chefs, such as Sadaharu Aoki, mix French and Japanese culinary traditions and pastries in an amazing way.\n",
    "\n",
    "And to face this diversity, it's therefore important to be strategically placed in Paris to attract people. That's why for this problem. We would need to study different important point to decide about the location of the restaurant in Paris.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Which kind of population in the different neigberhoods. (Depending on which kind of restaurant we want to open, the location may vary)\n",
    "\n",
    "* Is there any centers near to this place and maybe there would be more floating people. \n",
    "\n",
    "* What's the influence during the day in the different neighberhood \n",
    "\n",
    "* Are thre any work center close to our place so that people could eat at noon\n",
    "\n",
    "* The peers, competitors in the different place\n",
    "\n",
    "* Shops and market around our place, Can a short circuit be used ? Can we find a way to have fresh product every day\n"
